**A simple, completely customizable, multilingual Hugo theme thought for professionals and small businesses.**

I built this theme with simplicity in mind, it is small and easily **customizable, responsive, modular and multilingual**. But it also leaves some space to further in-depth customization since it uses **Bootstrap** and **SCSS**.

Here there's the [theme github page](https://github.com/ololiuhqui/magnolia-free-hugo-theme), to which you should refer if you seek for more details, make sure to star the repo!

Look at what this theme is capable to do on the features page, and see a beautiful contacts page example below.
